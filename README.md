# Technologies Memory Game🧠

[**Technologies Memory Game**](https://techsmemo.netlify.app) is a basic memory game made from scratch with ReactJS — _with Context API_ — and TailwindCSS. The objective of the game is to flip all the technologies in the least possible number of flips🔁 and time⏳.

The game provides a pool of **+75 possible technologies**👨‍💻 and a _very comfortable playground_ with a *simple UI/UX design*💻.
